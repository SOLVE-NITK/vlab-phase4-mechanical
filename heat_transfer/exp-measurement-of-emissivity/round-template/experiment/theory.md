## INTRODUCTION<br>

#### User Objectives and Goals:

To study properties of black body

To determine the emissivity of the test slab



#### Theory

When heat is supplied at a constant rate to a body, heat loss takes place by conduction, convection and radiation. If two bodies of the same geometry are heated under identical conditions, the heat loss by conduction and convection can be assumed to be same for both the bodies.

<br>The heat loss by radiation depends on:

Characteristic of the material<br>
Geometry of the surface<br>
Temperature of the surface<br>
Rate of heat loss to surrounding air by radiation is given by:<br>
Q=σA11T14-T24<br>
σ = Stefan-Boltzmann constant = 5.67×10-8W/m2K4<br>
A1 = surface area (m2)
ϵ1 = emissivity<br>
T1 = surface temperature of the body (K)<br>
T2 = surrounding atmospheric temperature (K)




#### Equations/formulas:

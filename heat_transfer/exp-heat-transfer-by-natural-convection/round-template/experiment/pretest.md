## <b> Pre-test</b>
#### Please attempt the following questions

1. Conduction plus fluid flow in motion is known as
<br>
a) Radiation
<br>
b) Conduction
<br>
c) Convection
<br>
d) Heat exchanger

<br>
Answer: c

Explanation: It is convection i.e. conduction plus some velocity. It is the process of energy transport affected by the mixing of a fluid medium.

<br>
2. A finned tube hot water radiator with a fan blowing air over it is kept in rooms during winter. The major portion of the heat transfer from the radiation is due to
<br>
a) Combined conduction and radiation
<br>
b) Radiation to the surroundings
<br>
c) Better conduction
<br>
d) Convection to the air

<br>
Answer: d

Explanation: Convection is a process in which thermal energy is transferred between solid and fluid flowing through it.

<br>
3. Convection heat transfer coefficient depends upon.
<br>
a: Geometry of surface
<br>
b: Characteristics of fluid
<br>
c: Thermal properties of fluid
<br>
d: All of the above
<br>
Answer - d

<br>
4. Which of the following is true about Convection?
<br>
a: Convection is the process of heat transfer in fluids by the actual motion of matter
<br>
b: It happens in liquids and gasses
<br>
c: It may be natural or forced
<br>
d: All of the above
<br>
Answer - d

<br>
5. Forced convection happens when the fluid is kept in motion by an external means, such as a turbine or a fan.
<br>
a: True 
<br>
b: False 
<br>
Answer - a

## <b> Pre-test</b>
#### Please attempt the following questions

1) When a fluid is used in a Shell and Tube heat exchanger, which one of the following is not true?<br>
a) If the fluid is gas then the gas side heat transfer coefficient is the lowest<br>
b) Extended fins are used on the shell side to increase the Heat Transfer coefficient<br>
c) Baffles are provided only to work as fins<br>
d) Fins increase necessary heat transfer area<br>


Answer: c

Explanation: Fins are generally used to increase the Heat transfer Area when the heat transfer coefficient on that fluid side is comparatively low. Hence as gases usually have lower heat transfer coefficients, fins are kept on this side. Also baffles are provided to give support to the tubes and increase the turbulence of the fluid in shell side.

2) In how many categories heat exchangers are classified on the basis of direction of flow of fluids?<br>
a) 4 categories
b) 3 categories
c) 2 categories
d) 1 categories


Answer: b

Explanation: Parallel, counter and cross flow

## INTRODUCTION<br>

#### User Objectives and Goals:

1. To determine the Log mean temperature difference.
2. To determine the  overall heat transfer coefficient for the inside area.
3. To determine the effectiveness of the heat exchanger.


#### Theory

Heat transfer from one fluid to another fluid is given by the expression,<br>
Q=A×U×(∆T)_m<br>
Where,<br>
	 (∆T)_m is the mean temperature difference
	U is the overall heat transfer coefficient for the inside area<br>
	A is the inside area of the heat exchanger<br>


Temperature Profiles for Parallel and Counter Flow Heat Exchangers

For which (∆T)_m = (θ_i-θ_o)/log⁡(θ_i⁄θ_o )

	Parallel Flow	Counter Flow

θi	Thi - Tci	Thi - Tco<br>
θo	Tho - Tco	Tho - Tci

This expression for the mean temperature difference is known as the Log Mean Temperature Difference (LMTD).

U=  Q_absorbed/((∆T)_m×A)

In order to make comparisons between various types of heat exchangers, the term Heat Exchanger Effectiveness is used, which is defined as:

ϵ=  (Actual heat transfer)/(Maximum possible heat transfer)

Actual heat transfer may be computed by calculating the energy lost by the hot fluid or the energy gained by the cold fluid as<br>
 Q= C_h (T_hi-T_ho ) or Q= C_c (T_co-T_ci ).

Both for parallel and counter flow heat exchanger where<br>
 C_h= W_h C_(p_h ) and C_c= W_c C_(p_c )

Wh = weight of hot fluid flowing per unit time<br>
Wc = weight of cold fluid flowing per unit time<br>
Cph and Cpc are the specific heats of the hot and cold fluid respectively<br>
Maximum possible heat transfer is given by <br>
Q_max= C_min (T_hi-T_ci )

Where Cmin is either Cph or Cpc, whichever is lesser.
Hence, effectiveness

ϵ=  (C_h (T_hi-T_ho ))⁄(C_min (T_hi-T_ci ) )<br>
ϵ=  (C_c (T_co-T_ci ))⁄(C_min (T_hi-T_ci ) )

U=  Q_absorbed/((∆T)_m×A)<br>

ffectiveness (ϵ)

ϵ=  (C_h (T_hi-T_ho ))⁄(C_min (T_hi-T_ci ) )<br>
ϵ=  (C_c (T_co-T_ci ))⁄(C_min (T_hi-T_ci ) )

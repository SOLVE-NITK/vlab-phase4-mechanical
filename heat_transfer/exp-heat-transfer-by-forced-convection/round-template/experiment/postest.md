## Post test

1. The convective heat transfer coefficient in laminar flow over a flat plate

a) Increases with distance
b) Increases if a higher viscosity fluid is used<br>
c) Increases if a denser fluid is used
d) Decreases with increase in free stream velocity

Answer: c

Explanation: It mostly increases if a denser fluid is used.


2. For laminar flow over a flat plate, the average value of a Nusselt number is prescribed by the relation

Nu = 0.664 (Re) 0.5 (Pr) 0.33
Which of the following is then a false statement?
a) Density has to be increased four times
b) Plate length has to be decreased four times<br>
c) Specific heat has to be increased four times
d) Dynamic viscosity has to be decreased sixteen times

Answer: d

Explanation: The dynamic viscosity has an inverse relation to 1/6 power. To double the convective heat transfer coefficient, the dynamic viscosity has to be decreased 64 times.

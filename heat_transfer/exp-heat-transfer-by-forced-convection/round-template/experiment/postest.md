1. The convective heat transfer coefficient in laminar flow over a flat plate
<br>
a) Increases with distance
<br>
b) Increases if a higher viscosity fluid is used
<br>
c) Increases if a denser fluid is used
<br>
d) Decreases with increase in free stream velocity

<br>
Answer: c

Explanation: It mostly increases if a denser fluid is used.

<br>
2. For laminar flow over a flat plate, the average value of a Nusselt number is prescribed by the relation
<br>
Nu = 0.664 (Re) 0.5 (Pr) 0.33
Which of the following is then a false statement?
<br>
a) Density has to be increased four times
<br>
b) Plate length has to be decreased four times
<br>
c) Specific heat has to be increased four times
<br>
d) Dynamic viscosity has to be decreased sixteen times

<br>
Answer: d
<br>
Explanation: The dynamic viscosity has an inverse relation to 1/6 power. To double the convective heat transfer coefficient, the dynamic viscosity has to be decreased 64 times.

<br>
3. Heat transfer ____________is conventionally known as convection heat transfer.
<br>
a: between fluid and fluid  
<br>
b: between a surface and a fluid
<br>
c: only on surface   
<br>
d: None of the above
<br>
Answer: b

<br>
4. If the fluid movement is accelerated by an external device such as a fan or pump, then the process is known as?
<br>
a: Natural convection 
<br>
b: Forced convection
<br>
c: Both a & b
<br>
d: none of the above
<br>

Answer: b

<br>
5. What do you mean by forced convection evaporator?
<br>
a: This is nucleate boiling
<br>
b: This has fan to remove vapor from the surface
<br>
c: There is an agitator to mix the heated fluid
<br>
d: There is an agitator to mix the heating medium such as steam<br>

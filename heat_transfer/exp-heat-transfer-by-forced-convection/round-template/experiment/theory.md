#### Theory
It is well know that a hot plate of metal will cool faster in from a fan than when exposed to
still air. We say that the heat is convected away and we call the process as convective heat
transfer. The velocity at which air blows over the hot plate obviously influences the heat
transfer rate.

The Newton‟s law of cooling in convective heat transfer is given by

Q=h A ∆T<br>
Where, Q=heat transfer rate, watt<br>
 A=surface area of heat flow, m2<br>
 ∆T=overall temperature difference between the wall and fluid in ⁰C
 h= convective heat transfer coefficient (W/m2
⁰C).

The convective heat transfer coefficient depends upon the viscosity of the fluid in addition to
its dependence on the thermal properties of the fluid (thermal conductivity, specific heat,
density, etc). If a heated plate is exposed to ambient room air without all external source of
motion, movement of air would be experienced as a result of the density gradient heat near
plate. We call this natural or free convection. If the convection is experienced the case of the
fan blowing air over a plate, we call this forced convection

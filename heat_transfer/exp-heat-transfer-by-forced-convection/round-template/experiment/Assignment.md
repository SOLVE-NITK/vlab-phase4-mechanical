Q. Air at 1 atmosphere pressure and 27℃ Blows across a 12mm diameter sphere at a small heater inside the sphere maintains the surface temperature at 77℃ with k = 0.026 W/m ( kelvin) and with (Nu) = 31.4, the heat loss by the sphere would be?
<br>
Solution -
<br> 
Given:
<br>
Nu = 31.4
<br>
k = 0.026W/mK
<br>
D = 12mm
<br>
r = 6x10e-3 m
<br>
Surface temperature Ts= 27℃
<br>
Atmospheric temperature T∞= 77℃
<br>
Nu = h x lc/k
<br>
h =  (Nu x k)/lc = 31.4 x 0.026/0.012 = 68.03 W/m2K
<br>
Surface area of sphere A = 4πr2 = 43.14(6  10-3)2
<br>
Qloss = 68.03x4x3.14(6x10e-3)2 x (77-27) = 1.57J/s
<br>
Qloss = 1.57J/s.

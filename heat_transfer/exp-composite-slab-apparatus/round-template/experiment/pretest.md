d)  Multiple homogenous layers

    Answer:  b<br>

    Explanation: Walls of houses where bricks are given a layer of plaster on either side.

2.  When a composite wall of three layers in series having thermal resistances R1, R2 and R3 respectively. The heat transfer takes place normal to the surface of the layers. How is the total thermal resistance of the composite system calculated?

a. 1 / (R1 + R2 + R3)

b. ( (1 / R1) + (1 / R2) + (1 / R3) )

c. (R1 + R2 + R3)

d. none of the above

Answer:  b<br>

## INTRODUCTION<br>

#### User Objectives and Goals:

1. To determine the: thermal conductivity of the insulating material
2. to plot the radial temperature distribution in the cylinder.


#### Theory
Materials that offer high resistance to the flow of heat are called as heat insulators. Heat insulators find extensive application in the systems where heat losses are to be minimized such as heat transmission lines in power plants, furnaces etc.

In many heat transfer equipment, heat loss to the surroundings is to be minimized to the maximum economy. In such cases, they are lagged by materials of lower thermal conductivity, which are referred to as insulators. Powders have the advantage of taking any shape between any two conforming surfaces. In addition, its thermal conductivity will be much lower than that of the solid from which it was made. This is because of the large air space between the particles, which have very low values of thermal conductivity. Thermal conductivity of such material is a complicated function of geometry of the particles, thermal conductivity of the particles, the nature of heat transfer between the air particles which depends of the magnitude of the air space and temperature etc. Thus, it is very difficult to estimate the thermal conductivity in most practical cases. The set up provided is one such apparatus to find thermal conductivity.

Rate of heat transfer through a material is given by,
Q = K A (ΔT/ΔX)

Where,
Q = Rate of heat transfer in Watt
K = Co-efficient of thermal conductivity in W/m0C
A = Area of heat transfer in m2
ΔT = Temperature between the walls in0C
ΔX = Thickness of the material in m

Insulators have low thermal conductivities say, about 0.1W/m0C to 1W/m0C whereas metals
which are good thermal conductors have co-efficient of thermal conductivity as high as
200W/m0C

This setup has been designed to study conduction heat transfer through insulating powder and
to determine its co-efficient of thermal conductivity.

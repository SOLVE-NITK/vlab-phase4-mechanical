## INTRODUCTION<br>

#### User Objectives and Goals:

  1. To find temperatures at successive lengths.

  2. To find temperature gradient.
  3. To find thermal conductivity of rod.


#### Theory
Conduction is a process of heat transfer through solids, liquids and gases. When the temperature gradient exists in a body, experience has shown that there is a transfer of heat from the high temperature region to the low temperature region. The heat transfer rate per unit is proportional to the temperature gradient in the direction of heat flow:  

Q/A α (∆T/∆X)

Where “Q” is the heat transfer in (watts), “A” is the area of heat transfer (m2), ∆T/∆X is the temperature gradient in the direction of heat flow (⁰C/m). Where the proportionality constant is a property of a material and is known as thermal conductivity.  

Q/A = -k (∆T/∆X)  

The positive constant “k” is called the coefficient of thermal conductivity of material. The negative sign indicates that heat transfer takes place in the direction of decreasing temperature. Coefficient of thermal conductivity has the units of W/m⁰C. Note that heat flow rate is involved and the numerical value of the coefficient of thermal conductivity indicates how fast heat will flow in each material. Thermal conductivity coefficient is a physical property of the material. Although it is constant in a narrow temperature range, it varies over a wide temperature range. Metals, which are good conductors of heat, have high values of coefficient of thermal conductivity;  
for example, 385 W/m⁰C for copper. Insulating materials have low values of coefficient of thermal conductivity for example 0.048 W/m⁰C for fibre insulating board. In any conduction heat transfer problem, it is essential to have the knowledge of the coefficient of thermal conductivity of the material involved in the heat transfer process. This setup has been designed to measure the temperature gradient along the length of the aluminum rod and to determine its coefficient of thermal conductivity.  


#### Equations/formulas:

heat conducted through the rod = heat carried away by the cooling water.

         Q= -kA dT/dx= m_f C_p (T_6-T_7 )

  Thus, the thermal conductivity k of metal rod can be evaluated.  

         dT/dx=k= -(m_f C_p (T_6-T_7 ))/(A dT/dx)= -Q/A×dT/dx

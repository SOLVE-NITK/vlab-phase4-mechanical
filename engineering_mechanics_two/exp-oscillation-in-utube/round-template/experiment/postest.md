Q1. A student wants to find the absolute pressure of water at a point below the surface of water. He has a barometer and a manometer pressure gauge. The barometer reads 1.3152 bar where as the manometer pressure gauge reads 0.3152 bar. What is the absolute pressure? (assume that pressure at one end of the manometer is atmospheric).  
A. 1 bar  
**B. 1.6304 bar**   
C. 0.3152 bar    
D. 1.3152 bar  

Q2. In a U-tube, one end is available to the atmosphere, the opposite end appended to a pressurized gas of check weight 40 kPa. The height of the liquid segment in the atmospheric side is 60 cm, and that on the gas side is 30 cm. The manometric liquid utilized is: (Take g = 9.8 m/s2).  
A. Water  
B. Liquid ammonia  
C. Oil  
**D. mercury**  

Q3. In a U-tube mercury filled cylinder, one end is presented to the environment and the opposite end is associated with a pressurized gas. The measure weight of the gas is observed to be 40 kPa. Presently, we change the manometric liquid to water. The tallness contrast changes by: (ρmercury = 13600 kg/m3, ρwater = 1000 kg/m3).  
**A. 1260%**  
B. 92.64%  
C. Remains unchanged (0%)  
D. 13.6%  


Q4. What will be the height raised by the fluid in the limb if a pressure difference of 200 kPa is applied across the limb for a fluid of density 1450 kg/m<sup>3</sup> ?      
A. 12mm      
B. 10mm  
**C. 14mm**  
D. 18mm  


Q5. What will be the pressure difference across the limbs if a fluid of density 1000 kg/m3 rises by a height of 31mm?  
**A. 300 kPa**  
B. 250 kPa  
C. 450 kPa  
D. 150 kPa  


Q6. What will be the time period of oscillation for a fluid which is raised by 28mm with respect to equilibrium position in one of the limbs of the U tube?  
A. 0.7 second  
**B. 0.5 second**  
C. 0.2 second  
D. 0.4 second

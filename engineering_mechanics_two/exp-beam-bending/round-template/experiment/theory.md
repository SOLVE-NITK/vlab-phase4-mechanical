The study of mechanics of materials is the study of the behaviour of solid bodies under
load. The way in which they react to applied forces, the deflections resulting and the stresses and strains set up within the bodies, are all considered in an attempt to provide sufficient knowledge to enable any component to be designed such that it will not fail within its service life.

Finding out the relation between deflection and force applied on a beam with square cross-section. We can clearly observe the increase in deflection when force is increased which is obtained through strength of materials approach.

In practice, all engineering applications limitations are placed upon the performance and behaviour of components and normally they are expected to operate within certain set limits of, for example, stress or deflection. The stress limits are normally set so that the component does not yield or fail under the most severe load conditions which it is likely to meet in service. In certain structural or machine linkage designs, however, maximum stress levels may not be the most severe condition for the component in question. In such cases it is the limitation in the maximum deflection which places the most severe restriction on the operation or design of the component. It is evident, therefore, that methods are required to accurately predict the deflection of members under lateral loads since it is this form of loading which will generally produce the greatest deflections of beams, struts and other structural types of members.

**Equations/formulas:**  
The following relationships exists between loading, shearing force(S.F), bending moment(B.M), slope and deflection of beam:

For finding out deflection using the bending moment equation we can use the above equations.  
<div style="text-align: center"><img src="./images/equation1.png"/></div>    
This gives us the deflection directly.

The above relations hold good for finding out BMD, SFD from the given equation.

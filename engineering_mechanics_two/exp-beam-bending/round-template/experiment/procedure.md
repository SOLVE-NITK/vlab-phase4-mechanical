#### These procedure steps will be followed on the simulator
<div style="text-align: justify">

1. In simulation window beam is displayed with force on top, variable position.   

2. There are sliders given on the right side of the screen for choosing the values of input variables, viz. position and magnitude of the force acting on the beam. After setting these variables, deflection along with SFD and BMD can be seen on the screen.

3. Move to the next page to check on further simulations related to Cantilever configuration and simply supported configuration.

4. Compare analytically calculated results and the error in the result with the simulation results, displayed in the bottom of the simulator page.

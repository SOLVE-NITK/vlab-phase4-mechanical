<br>


1. “The quality of steam at saturated vapour point is 100%”. Please indicate whether this statement is<br>
    <b>a) True </b><br>
    b) False<br>

2. For a substance in the two-phase region,<br>
    a) both pressure and temperature are independent properties<br>
    <b>  b) if pressure is given, the saturation temperature gets fixed</b><br>
    c) no other property is required to be known<br>
    d) all of the mentioned<br>
3. For the measurement of quality, the state of the substance is brought from the two-phase region to<br>
    a) single-phase region<br>
    b) superheated region<br>
    <b>c) both of the mentioned</b><br>
    d) none of the mentioned<br>

4. To fix the state and determine the quality of the mixture, we can do this by<br>
    a) adiabatic throttling<br>
    b) electric heating<br>
  <b>  c) both of the mentioned</b><br>
    d) none of the mentioned<br>
5. Throttling calorimeter can be used alone for<br>
  <b>  a)  high dryness fraction upto 0.98</b><br>
    b)  very low dryness fraction upto 0.7<br>

6. To be sure that steam after throttling is in the single-phase or superheated region, a minimum of ____ superheat is desired.<br>
    a) 10 degree Celsius<br>
    b)  -5 degree Celsius<br>
    c) 0 degree Celsius<br>
  <b>  d)  5 degree Celsius</b><br>

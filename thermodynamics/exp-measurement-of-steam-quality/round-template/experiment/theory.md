## INTRODUCTION<br>

#### User Objectives and Goals:

1. Define the procedure for the measurement of steam quality.
2. Interpret the setup i.e., the throttling valve arrangement.
3. Calculate specific enthalpy and quality of steam.
4. Examine the effect of change in parameters like Outlet pressure and Outlet temperature on the parameters like enthalpy.
5. Analyse how change in parameters like Outlet pressure and Outlet temperature can affect the quality of steam using a bar graph.

#### Theory
In the throttling calorimeter, a sample of wet steam of pressure P1 is taken from a steam main through a perforated sampling tube. Then it is throttled by the partially open valve to a pressure P2, measured by mercury manometer, and temperature T2, so that after throttling, the steam is in the superheated region. The steady flow energy equation gives the enthalpy after throttling as equal to enthalpy before throttling. The initial state(wet) is given by P1 and x1, and the final state by P2 and T2(superheated).
(Reference: PK Nag, Basic and Applied Thermodynamics).


#### Equations/formulas:
1. P1 = Inlet/initial pressure
2. P2 = Outlet/final pressure
3. T2 = Outlet/final temperature
4. h1 = specific enthalpy of saturated state ( at inlet )
5. h2 = specific enthalpy of superheated state ( at outlet )
6. x1 = Quality of steam at inlet
7. h<sub>f</sub> = specific enthalpy of saturated liquid state at pressure P1
8. h<sub>g</sub> = specific enthalpy of saturated vapor state at pressure P1
9. h<sub>fg</sub> = change in specific enthalpy during phase transition

#### These procedure steps will be followed on the simulator

1. In the simulation window, a front view of the throttling valve is available.
2.  The parameters of the system can be varied by changing the variables as shown below.

3. Move the knob of the slider to change the value of Outlet temperature which varies among three values 100°C, 125°C and 150 °C. The value of Outlet pressure can vary among six values 0.01 MPa, 0.02 MPa, 0.03 MPa, 0.04 MPa, 0.05 MPa and 0.06 MPa.

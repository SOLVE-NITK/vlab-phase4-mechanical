## INTRODUCTION<br>

#### User Objectives and Goals:

  1.  Understand the use of the thermodynamics data handbook and the concept behind the saturated and superheated water tables.
  2.  Understand the various thermodynamics properties such as the enthalpy, internal energy, entropy and their units.
  3. Visualize the required quantities in the table that have been marked.
  4. Calculate the specific thermodynamics properties using the necessary values from the table.


#### Theory

#### These procedure steps will be followed on the simulator

1. In the simulation window, the thermodynamics data handbook saturated and superheated water tables are available.
2. The various symbols, instructions and the formulae are displayed in the control panel when the cursor hovers over ‘Abbreviations’, ‘Instructions’ and ‘Formulae’ respectively.

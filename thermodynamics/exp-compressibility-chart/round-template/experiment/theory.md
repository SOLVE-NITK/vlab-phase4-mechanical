## INTRODUCTION<br>

#### User Objectives and Goals:

1. Understand and learn to read the Nelson-Obert generalized compressibility chart.
2. Visualize the method to read the graph with the help of the animated dotted lines drawn on the graph.
3. Analyze the method used to find out the unknown quantity with the help of the formulae given in the formulae tab.
4. Calculate any two of the reduced pressure, reduced temperature and reduced volume (depending on which of the three quantities among pressure, temperature and volume are known).
5. Calculate the final unknown quantity (pressure, temperature or volume).
6. Observe the effect of the gas used and the change in the values of P, v, T on the compressibility factor Z.
7. Observe the usage of different kinds of graphs for different values of reduced pressure.

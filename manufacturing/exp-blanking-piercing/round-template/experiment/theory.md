#### Theory
Metal cutting is a process used for separating a piece of material of predetermined shape and size from the remaining portion of a strip or sheet of metal. It is one of the most extensively used processes throughout die and sheet-metal work. It consists of several different material-parting operations, such a piercing, perforating, shearing, notching, cutoff, and blanking.The selection criteria of all process parameters are governed by the sheet thickness and by the strength of the work-piece material being pierced.
The punch/die clearance is a crucial parameter, which determines the load or pressure experienced at the cutting edge of the tool, commonly known as point pressure. Excessive point pressure can lead to accelerated wear and ultimately failure. the surface quality of the trimmed edge is severely affected by the clearance, too.
Material specific design guidelines are developed by companies in order to define the minimum acceptable values of hole diameters, bridge sizes, slot dimensions. Similarly, the strip lay-out must be determined (strip width and pitch). The bridge width between the parts and the edge allowance between the part and the edge of the strip also have to be selected.
A simple operation may only need a pancake die. While many dies perform complex procedures simultaneously, a pancake die may only perform one simple procedure with the finished product being removed by hand.
In blanking, the piece is cut off from the sheet, and it becomes a finished part. In piercing, the cut-out portion is scrap which gets disposed off while the product part travels on through the remainder of the die. The terminology is different here, though both processes are basically the same and therefore belong to the same category, which is the process of metal cuttingMachinery used for blanking ranges from simple punches and dies to sophisticated CNC machinery. Blanking equipment can quickly be configured to end product specifications, and the process itself takes little time per part as it involves simply feeding the primary metal stock continuously into the blanking machine.
Because of this, blanking can perform long production runs that require little or no changes to the machinery or base material. The straightforward process also allows you to construct materials to strict tolerances with little part-to-part variation, and technology has become so sophisticated that it can build multiple geometries using a single process.
Furthermore, because the primary metal stock can be reused, blanking can help manufacturing firms reduce their material waste. Due to these benefits, blanking is commonly used to mass produce components for industries such as aerospace and automobile manufacturing. Itâ€™s also used for high-volume fabrication of parts for common household

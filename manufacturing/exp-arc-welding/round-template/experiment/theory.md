## INTRODUCTION<br>

#### User Objectives and Goals:

  1. State what is arc welding and different joints in welding
  2.Describe conditions to be satisfied during a welding process
  3.Understand which type of welding and joint should be used in a situation
  4.Examine and compare the lap joint and v-but joint.
  5.Attempt assessment questions.



#### Theory
In arc welding, developed in the mid-1800s, the heat required is obtained from electrical energy. The process involves either a non-consumable or a consumable electrode. An arc or a DC power supply produces an arc between the tip of the electrode and the work-piece to be welded. The arc generates temperatures of about 30,000°C, much higher than those developed in oxyfuel–gas welding.<a href="references.html">[1]</a>

Electric arc welding is the most extensively used method of joining components of metallic parts, the source of heat being an electric arc. An electric arc is a continuous stream of electrons flowing through some sort of medium between two conductors of an electric circuit and accompanied by intense heat generation and radiation.

In this simulation, the arc welding technique is used to join two workpieces by both lap joint and V-Butt joint. First, both the workpieces are filed and cleaned using a grinder and wire brush. Then the workpieces are placed in the correct positions for the required type of joint. After that, the welding process is started and finally, the workpiece is cleaned.

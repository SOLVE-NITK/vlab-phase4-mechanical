## INTRODUCTION<br>

#### User Objectives and Goals:

  1) State what is moulding processes
  2)Differentiate injection moulding and blow moulding
  3)Advantages of blow moulding compared to other methods
  4)Materials that can be subjected to moulding processes
  5)Attempt assessment questions.



#### Theory
Polymers can be divided into three broad divisions: plastics, fibers and elastomers (polymers of high elasticity, for example, rubber). Synthetic resins are usually referred to as plastics. Plastics are classified on the broad basis of whether heat causes them to set( thermosetting) or causes them to soften and melt(thermoplastic). An important industrial method of producing articles of thermoplastics is Injection Moulding. The moulding material is loaded into a hopper from which it is transferred to a heating section by a feeding device, where the temperature is raised to 1500C â€“ 3700C and pressure is built up. The material melts and is forced by an injection ram at high pressure through a nozzle and sprue into a closed mould which forms the part. The mould is in at least two sections, so that it may be split in order to eject the finished component. For the process to be competitive the mould must be fairly cool (between ambient temperature and the softening point of the plastic) and consequently the mould must be cooled by circulating air.
The set up consists of a injection moulding machine with a mould attached according to the product required. There is a funnel open where plastic granules are to be filled. Switches to heat and move the coil are present in the machine. Usually, the plastic materials are formed in the shape of pellets or granules and sent from the raw material manufacturers in paper bags. With injection moulding, pre-dried granular plastic is fed by a forced ram from a hopper into a heated barrel. As the granules are slowly moved forward by a screw-type plunger, the plastic is forced into a heated chamber, where it is melted. As the plunger advances, the melted plastic is forced through a nozzle that rests against the mould, allowing it to enter the mould cavity through a gate and runner system. The mould remains cold so the plastic solidifies almost as soon as the mould is filled.
Injection moulding is used to create many things such as wire spools, packaging, bottle caps, automotive parts and components, toys, pocket combs, some musical instruments (and parts of them), one-piece chairs and small tables, storage containers, mechanical parts (including gears), and most other plastic products available today. Injection moulding is the most common modern method of manufacturing plastic parts; it is ideal for producing high volumes of the same object.

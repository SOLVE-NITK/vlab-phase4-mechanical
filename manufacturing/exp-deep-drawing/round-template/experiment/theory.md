#### Theory
Deep drawing is a sheet metal forming process in which a sheet metal blank is radially drawn into a forming die by the mechanical action of a punch. It is thus a shape transformation process with material retention. The process is considered "deep" drawing when the depth of the drawn part exceeds its diameter. This is achieved by redrawing the part through a series of dies. The operation is carried out on a pass with a punch and dies as shown in the figure. The material initially flat flanges of the blank flows to form the walls of the cup. Due to shrinkage of the outer periphery, circumferential compressive stress develops which might thicken the sheet or cause local buckling (wrinkling). The flange region (sheet metal in the die shoulder area) experiences radial drawing stress and tangential compressive stress due to the material retention property. These compressive stresses (hoop stresses) result in flange wrinkles (wrinkles of the first order). Wrinkles can be prevented by using a blank holder, the function of which is to facilitate controlled material flow into the die radius.
The initial setup consists of a hydraulic press, a metal sheet blank and a blank holder. The blank has to be placed in the press with blank holder above it to hold the blank while applying the force. The sheet metal blank is radially drawn into a forming die by the mechanical action of a punch.

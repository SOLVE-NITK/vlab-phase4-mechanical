#### Theory
Casting is one of oldest and one of the most popular processes of converting materials into final useful shapes. Casting process is primarily used for shaping metallic materials; although it can be adopted for shaping other materials such as ceramic, polymeric and glassy materials. In casting, a solid is melted, treated to proper temperature and then poured into a cavity called mold, which contains it in proper shape during solidification. Simple or complex shapes can be made from any metal that can be melted. The resulting product can have virtually any configuration the designer desires.
The sand casting process employs techniques that produce shaped parts of nearly any design, including very large parts and those with internal passageways. There may be more optimal casting or metalworking processes for any specific product, based on needed tolerances, design intricacy, volume, tooling availability, or lead time, but it is likely that a casting in the needed configuration could be made using the sand process.  That is a decision left to the design engineer.
The process is referred to as sand casting because the mold that contains the cavity into which metal is poured is made of compressed or compacted sand. The sand contains some other material that encourages it to hold its shape
There are several categories of sand casting, usually defined by the type of binder used to hold the sand together. There are different sands or artificial aggregates in wide use, each of which can be used in multiple sand casting processes. The most common sand is silica, which is an oxide of the element silicon. Silica sands are the most abundant sand in nature and have satisfactory moulding characteristics. Other sands that are commonly used include olivine, zircon, and chromite. Zircon and chromite sands have low thermal expansion and high thermal conductivity. That high conductivity can be used to improve the soundness and mechanical properties of castings. Synthetic aggregates, including alumina, bauxite, and mullite are used in some special applications. These materials are hard, wear resistant, and spherical, making them an ideal moulding material. Because the cost is higher than natural sands, recycling efficiency needs to be high to make them economically viable. The principal properties required of the moulding media are green strength and flowability, defined as the ability of material to be compacted to a uniform density. Green strength is required so that the pattern can be withdrawn from the mould without distortion or collapse. The balance between strength and flowability is determined based on the compaction method used in the moulding process
The set up consists of a rectangular box in which sand is filled and enough amount of sand depending on the size of pattern and box. A pattern  made up of 2 parts in the desired shape . The setup also include two hollow metal roads to act as riser and sprue. Molten metal/ the raw material from which cast is to be made has to be kept ready with necessary fluxes mixed. Grinder/blades are required for cutting away unwanted parts and the final finishing of product

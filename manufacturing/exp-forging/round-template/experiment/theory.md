#### Theory
Forging is a manufacturing process involving the shaping of metal using localized compressive forces. The blows are delivered with a hammer (often a power hammer) or a die. Forging is often classified according to the temperature at which it is performed: cold forging (a type of cold working), warm forging, or hot forging (a type of hot working). For the latter two, the metal is heated, usually in a forge. Forged parts can range in weight from less than a kilogram to hundreds of metric tons.

Forging can produce a piece that is stronger than an equivalent cast or machined part. As the metal is shaped during the forging process, its internal grain texture deforms to follow the general shape of the part. As a result, the texture variation is continuous throughout the part, giving rise to a piece with improved strength characteristics. Additionally, forgings can achieve a lower total cost than casting or fabrication. Considering all the costs that are incurred in a product's life cycle from procurement to lead time to rework, and factoring in the costs of scrap, and downtime and other quality considerations, the long-term benefits of forgings can outweigh the short-term cost savings that castings or fabrications might offer.

<b>General Characteristics of Forging Processes</b>

Process	| Advantages | Limitations
:--|:--|:-:
Open die| Simple and inexpensive dies; wide range of part sizes; good strength characteristics; generally for small quantities| Limited to simple shapes; difficult to hold close tolerances; machining to final shape necessary; low production rate; relatively poor utilization of material; high degree of skill required
Closed die| Relatively good utilization of material; generally better properties than open-die forgings; good dimensional accuracy; high production rates; good reproducibility| High die cost, not economical for small quantities; machining often necessary
Blocker| Low die costs; high production rates| Machining to final shape necessary; parts with thick webs and large fillets
Conventional |Requires much less machining than blocker type; high production rates; good utilization of material| Higher die cost than blocker type
Precision |Close dimensional tolerances; very thin webs and flanges possible; machining generally not necessary; very good material utilization |High forging forces, intricate dies, and provision for removing forging from dies

In this simulation, open die forging is demonstrated. First, we are heating the given workpiece with the help of a heating coil. The hot workpiece is then placed in the hydraulic press. Proper safety equipment is used while handling hot workpiece. The press is turned on and the forging is done. Remove the workpiece from the machine and allow it to cool. Finally, finishing works are done.

of the billet without friction. (c) Deformation with friction; note barreling of the billet caused
by friction forces at the billet–die interfaces.

The forging force, F, in an open-die forging operation on a solid cylindrical workpiece can be estimated from the formula<br>

where Y<sub>f</sub> is the flow stress of the material, μ is the coefficient of friction between the workpiece and the die, and r and h are, respectively, the instantaneous radius and height of the workpiece.

#### Theory
Blow moulding is a moulding process used in the manufacturing industry to create hollow objects made of plastic. Like other moulding processes, it involves the use of heated, liquid material that’s forced into a mould cavity under pressure. Blow moulding is a special type of moulding process, however, that leverages the properties of traditional glassblowing. The defining characteristic of blow moulding is that it’s used to create hollow objects. Raw plastic is first heated, after which it’s formed into a parison. Next, the plastic parison is secured to the top of the mould. Finally, the air is blown down onto the plastic parison, thereby stretching it across the interior walls of the mould cavity. 
The terms “blow moulding” and “injection moulding” are often interchangeably when referring to moulding processes. While similar, though, they aren’t necessarily the same. Both blow moulding and injection moulding involve the use of liquid material — typically plastic — that’s forced into a mould cavity. The difference is that blow moulding is used to create hollow objects, whereas injection moulding is used to create solid objects. For hollow objects, only blow moulding offers a fast and effective solution for manufacturing companies.

In general, there are three main types of blow molding: extrusion blow molding, injection blow molding, and injection stretch blow molding.In extrusion blow molding (EBM), plastic is melted and extruded into a hollow tube (a parison). This parison is then captured by closing it into a cooled metal mold. Air is then blown into the parison, inflating it into the shape of the hollow bottle, container, or part. After the plastic has cooled sufficiently, the mold is opened and the part is ejected. Examples parts made by the EBM process: most polyethylene hollow products, milk bottles, shampoo bottles, automotive ducting, watering cans, and hollow industrial parts such as drums.
The process of injection blow molding (IBM) is used for the production of hollow glass and plastic objects in large quantities. In the IBM process, the polymer is injection molded onto a core pin; then the core pin is rotated to a blow molding station to be inflated and cooled. This is the least-used of the three blow molding processes, and is typically used to make small medical and single serve bottles. The process is divided into three steps: injection, blowing and ejection.

The injection blow molding machine is based on an extruder barrel and screw assembly which melts the polymer. The molten polymer is fed into a hot runner manifold where it is injected through nozzles into a heated cavity and core pin. The cavity mold forms the external shape and is clamped around a core rod which forms the internal shape of the preform. The preform consists of a fully formed bottle/jar neck with a thick tube of polymer attached, which will form the body. similar in appearance to a test tube with a threaded neck.

The preform mold opens and the core rod is rotated and clamped into the hollow, chilled blow mold. The end of the core rod opens and allows compressed air into the preform, which inflates it to the finished article shape.

After a cooling period the blow mold opens and the core rod is rotated to the ejection position. The finished article is stripped off the core rod and as an option can be leak-tested prior to packing. The preform and blow mold can have many cavities, typically three to sixteen depending on the article size and the required output. There are three sets of core rods, which allow concurrent preform injection, blow molding and ejection.

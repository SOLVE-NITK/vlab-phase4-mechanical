#### Theory
Rolling is the process of plastic deformation of metals by squeezing action as it passes between a pair of rotating rolls, either plane or grooved. The process may be carried out hot or cold. The most common rolling mill is the 2-high rolling mill, which consists of two rolls usually mounted horizontally in bearings at their ends and vertically above each other .The rolls may be driven through couplings at their ends by spindles, which are coupled, to pinions (or gears), which transmit the power from the electric motor. To control the relative positioning of rolls, a roll positioning system is employed on the mill stand. In small mills, such as the one in the laboratory, the roll positioning system called the ‘mill screw’ is hand driven, while in commercial mills they are motor driven. The 2-high mills could be either reversing or non-reversing type. In the reversing type, which is the most common one, the direction of motion of the rolls can be reversed, and therefore the work can be fed into the mill from both sides by reversing the direction of rotation of rolls.

For rolling to take place the roll separation or roll gap must be less than the in going size of the stock. After rolling, the height of the stock is reduced and length is increased. The difference in height of ingoing and outgoing is called ‘draught’. Picture shows a flat piece of metal of thickness h1, through a pair of rolls of radius R. The AC is called the ‘arc of contact’. The angle θ subtended at the roll center by the arc of contact is called the ‘angle of contact’ and can be evaluated from
<center>Cos θ = [1 – (ho – h1) /2R]</center><br>

If there is no elastic deflection of rolls during rolling, the final thickness of metal h1 is same as the roll gap. If elastic deflection of rolls occur, the final thickness of metal after rolling h1, is greater than the roll gap fixed before rolling. Depending upon the condition under which the metal is introduced into the roll gap, two situations can occur:
* The metal is gripped by the rolls and pulled along into the roll gap.
* The metal slips over the roll surface.

The process of rolling depends upon the frictional forces acting between the surfaces of the roll and the metal. The condition of biting or gripping of metals into rolls is μ ≥ tan θ, where μ is the coefficient of friction between the roll and metal surfaces. The maximum value of θ (θ<sub>max</sub> = tan<sup>-1</sup>λ) is often called the angle of bite. The average coefficient of friction can now be estimated as μ = tanθ<sub>max</sub>.

The rolls contact the rolling sheet along an arc defined by angle θ. Each roll has radius R, and its has surface velocity vr. This velocity is in between entry and exit velocity. However, there is one point or zone along the contact arc where work velocity equals roll velocity. This is called the no-slip point, or neutral point. On either side of the neutral point, slipping and friction occur between roll and sheet. The amount of slip between the rolls and the sheet can be quantified by forward slip,<br>
<center>S= (Vr-Vf)/Vr</center><br>   
where Vf is the final velocity, Vr is the roll velocity.

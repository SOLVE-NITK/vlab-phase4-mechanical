## INTRODUCTION<br>

#### User Objectives and Goals:

  1. State what is brazing.
  2. Describe conditions to be satisfied during a brazing process.
  3. Understand for which types of work-pieces brazing can be used.
  4. Examine and compare brazing with other welding techniques.
  5. Attempt assessment questions.




#### Theory
In brazing, metal parts to be joined are heated to a temperature below the melting point of the parts but sufficient to melt the lower fusion point filler material which is used to fill the gap at the joint and establish a bond between the edges through the filler material. The filler metal is drawn through the joint through the capillarity action to create a joint between the two pieces. In this process, the base metal does not melt and hence the metallurgy of the base metal is not disturbed much. However, this also implies that the joints made by this process are not as strong as those made by welding. On the other hand, this process can establish a joint between two dissimilar metals, through a proper choice of filler material. Unlike in welding, the filler rod differs widely in composition from the parent material(s). Gas (oxy-acetylene mixture) is usually used for heating.<br>

In this experiment, the two workpieces are joined by using the brazing process. First, both the workpieces are filed and cleaned using a grinder and wire brush. Then flux is applied after properly aligning the workpieces. After that, a filler rod is placed between the workpieces and heated with the help of a brazing torch. Finally, the workpiece is cleaned using a wire brush.

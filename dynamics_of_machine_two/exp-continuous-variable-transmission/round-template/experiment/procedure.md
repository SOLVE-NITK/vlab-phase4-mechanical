#### These procedure steps will be followed on the simulator

<div style="text-align: justify">

1. In simulation window two pulleys rotating on two shafts is displayed.    
2. There are sliders given on right side of the screen for choosing the values of input variables, viz., Output angular velocity Omega2 and theta1 and theta2. After setting the output angular velocity observe the change in pulley configuration.

3. After moving on, find out the gear ratio mentioned and as per requirement, change the theta1 and theta2 values to observe the corresponding change in pulley configuration.

Q1. Use of gear ratio is to provide required amount of torque/rpm required for constant power input  
**a. True**   
b. False  

Q2. Gear ratio > 1 reduces the output RPM, hence reducing the output power    
**a. False**  
b. True

Q3. For a gear ratio > 1, the following is true  
**a. RPM of driving is higher**  
b. RPM of driven is higher  
c. it doesnâ€™t depend on driving/driven RPM  
d. it depends only on belt material   

Q4.  Gear ratio in terms of driving and driven pulleys refers to  
**a. RPM of driving pulley/ RPM of driven pulley**  
b. RPM of driven pulley/ RPM of driving pulley  
c. Radius of driving pulley/ Radius of driven pulley  
d. None of the above

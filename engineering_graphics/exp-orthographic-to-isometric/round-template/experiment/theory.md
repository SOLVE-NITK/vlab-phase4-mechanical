**THEORY:**

The most convenient method of drawing the isometric view of any solid
object is the boxing method.Â  In this, the object is considered to be
placed in a rectangular box having dimensions with maximum dimensions of
the object along the three axes. The edges of the rectangular box are
the isometric axes and the surfaces of the rectangular box are the
isometric planes.

The four basic steps for creating an isometric drawing are:

1.  Positioning the object. Determine the isometric viewpoint that
    depicts maximum features of the object

2.  Once the object is positioned and the viewpoint is decided, draw the
    isometric axes which will produce that view-point.

3.  Construct isometric planes, using the overall width (W), height (H),
    and depth (D) of the object, such that the object will be enclosed
    in a box.

4.  Locate details on the isometric planes. Darken all visible lines,
    and eliminate hidden lines unless necessary to describe the object.
